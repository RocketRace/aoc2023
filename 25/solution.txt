* install graphviz
* download your input file
* regex-replace `: ` with ` -- {`, and `\n` with `}\n`
* pass the file to `dot -Tpng -Ksfdp` (sfdp because the number of nodes is fairly big)
* observe that cutting **qnv/mnh**, **mfs/ffv** and **ljh/tbg** disconnects the graph
* remove those from the file, verifying that the graph is infact disconnected
* pass that resulting file to `ccomps`
* for each subgraph:
    * take only the edges
    * regex-replace `\s*(\w+) -- (\w+);` with `$1(newline)$2`
    * use multicursor to copy all the nodes from the edges
    * paste them to a separate file
    * run the `Delete Duplicate Lines` command in vscode
* multiply the line counts
